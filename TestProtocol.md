## Instructions for preparation and setting up the testing environment

### Prerequisites for conducting the test:

​	- A laptop or desktop

​	- Internet connection

​	- A web browser (Google Chrome or Safari)

​	- Zoom on the computer running the test

### Setting up the test:

1. Meet up with testing user on Zoom

2. Ask for screen share from the user

3. Ask for consent on recording the session (part of introduction)

   1. If consent is given, record the session

   2. If consent is not given, prepare a method to take notes for the user test

4. Direct the user to open https://parkgunou.github.io/cs374-brownbanana/ on their browser

5. Start the test once ready! 



## Introduction and informed consent

Hello,

Thank you for participating in our prototype testing. This user testing is part of the design project for HCI course our team, Team Brown Banana, has worked on through this semester. 

Our project aims to redesign freelance hair stylists’ customer management and self-promotion experience, by addressing some drawbacks faced by freelance hair stylists when they move their workplaces or try to attract new customers.

We have currently developed a prototype for our application, and will greatly appreciate any feedback regarding the prototype, especially on the usability aspects of the prototype.

Before we get started with the session, we would like to kindly ask for consent on recording this session. The recording will be scoped to the screen you are testing with and your voice during the session, such that you can freely talk about your responses to the prototype without having to explain too much about what you are doing. They will be used to identify the usability issues you have experienced during the session and be discarded after two weeks.

Please bear in mind that consent is not mandatory, and you may choose to withdraw the consent at any time during or after the session. You can still help us through this user testing session without consent. However, as we will have to note-take the responses you give us in-context, the testing session may feel a little slower.

(If consent is given) Thank you for your consent. As per your consent, allow us to set up the recording environment. (Set up the environment step 3.1)

(If consent is not given) Thank you for your answer. It is perfectly fine; allow us to set up the testing environment. (Set up environment from step 3.2)

(Set up environment step 4)

This is the prototype for our solution. You will be given a set of tasks to attempt during the test. After you are finished, we will ask you a set of questions regarding your experience with the prototype in doing the tasks. There are no time limits, or correct answers, so feel free to take time and familiarize yourself with the prototype. It will be extremely helpful for us if you speak out any impressions or feedback whenever they cross your mind. Also, please take note that, should you wish to stop, you may stop this session at any time - just let us know.

Then, let’s get started!



## Task list & instruction:

1. Create new profile

   Create a new profile, and fill in the required information to express yourself to your potential customers. Check if your new profile is properly created.

2. Add new style menu

   Add your own hairdo menu and fill in the information such as price and description for your customers. Also, if any, add photos of your past hairdo procedures. Check if your style photos and menus are properly added. 

3. Edit your profile

   Edit your profile assuming you've changed your information, such as moving hair salons. 

4. Notify your followers about your change in workplace

   Notify your customers of changes in your workplaces, any change in bio, and so on. 

5. Search for your profile

   Search for your profile using various search queries provided. Click on your profile and check if all your information is properly shown in the search result.

   

## Recording Strategy

Our usability test will be conducted on Zoom. The user will be asked to share the screen so that we can observe how the user interacts with our system. The shared screen will be recorded for future analysis. At the same time, the user will be asked to turn on the microphone, and this will also be recorded. To make this work, we will ask the user to think aloud as much as possible, so that we can grasp the user’s mental model at the very moment. Written notes will also be utilized if necessary.

During the usability testing, our members will be playing the following roles:

A: As a facilitator, A will give the users a quick briefing of the test, inform them of tasks they are supposed to conduct, and ask questions to the users to help them think aloud. A is in charge of the overall testing process, such as asking the user to move on, answering questions from the user, removing any disturbance from the test, and so on.

B: B is an observer. He is not supposed to talk to the user, but just observe the shared screen and write down any interesting observations. He is also in charge of recording the session, and summarizing it after the session ends.

C: C is in charge of technical issues that might happen during the session. If any critical problem happens during the session that might halt the session, he should be able to solve the problem quickly or provide an alternative.

We will take turns in being facilitator, observer or technician, so that we might not get too used to the tasks or have bias in observing the user.



## Questionnaires, Interview questions

## Debrief Prompt

This is the end of the session. Thank you for participating in our prototype testing.

As you may have guessed during the testing session, our project targets freelance hair stylists in Korea, who do not have an open and legitimate way of contacting and managing their customers regardless of the hair salon they work in. This project is part of our coursework for HCI course at KAIST.

The user testing you have taken part in serves two purposes:

1. It is used to evaluate the effectiveness of our prototype
2. It is used to help our team (group of students enrolled in the HCI course) learn the general process of software development

This project is currently not in any sort of production for commercial service, and your input as usability testers will not be disclosed or used for any other purposes.

As mentioned earlier, if you do not wish to have your feedback or recording used, feel free to let us know within two weeks. Any time afterwards, your feedback and recording will be discarded anyways.

If there are any other questions or concerns, do not hesitate to contact us at any time.

Thank you very much for your participation!
